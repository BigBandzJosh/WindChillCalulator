# WindChillCalulator

This is a simple program that calculates the wind chill factor given the temperature and wind speed.

## Installation
1. clone repo
2. run `python wind_chill_calculator.py`
3. if you want to use a different dataset, you'll need to bring in the other file and change the file name in the code, should work well with any csv file with the same format.. specifically if the maxtemp and wind_speed columns are in the same positions in the CSV as mine. I hardcoded the column numbers in the code... bad idea lol.
4. update tests as needed

I always appriciate feedback and suggestions, I'm always looking to improve my code and learn new things and I won't be offended if you think my code is bad lol. Thanks:) 

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
